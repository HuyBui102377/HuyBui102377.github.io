        <h3>Doom Slayer</h3>
        <p>The story follows the main character, Doom Slayer, who must survive three rounds while massacring all the demons in your way. The score is the waves. The random
        factor that was implemented was the time interval and amount the demons are spawned. The game's difficulty increases as the wave increases, with more demons spawning
        We created this game because it was the first idea we had. The inspiration was Doom. Two successful points in development was the creation of the "spawn" code and the 
        shooting code. Two obsticles were figuring out the shooting and platform, which was cut. More time we would add a boss and platforms, in general making a deeper and more 
        entertaining experience. Possibly more weapons, buffs, and heals.</p>

        <p>This is an algorithm because its an execution of code in a designated order using ifs. This was integeral too the gone because it was the shooting system making the demon sprite dissapear when the bullet sprite
        touches it.</p>

        <p>My partner and I based our game's story and title on Hirohiko Araki's JoJo Bizzare Adventures Part 1 Phantom Blood. It was more of a fanfic and a 
        summary more than anything. We had altered some scenarios and removed some character for a more digestable game.The only problem we had was with python
        multiplayer not working. We solved this problem by having one partner write the code in Google Docs and the other copy and pasting the code onto python.</p>
        <p>Organizing our scenes into function is a form of procedural abstraction because it lets the player decides which function will play out and in which
        order. The advantage of abstracting our story into function is that it gives the viewer more freedom but still lets us control the game to an extent.</p>
        <p>One story form my classmates I enjoyed was Three of Swords. It had an intresting story and very diverse branching paths.</p>
